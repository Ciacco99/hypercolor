![Hypercolor](https://hypercolor.dev/social.png)

A curated collection of beautiful Tailwind CSS gradients using the full
range of Tailwind CSS colors. Easily copy and paste the class names, CSS
or even save the gradients as an image.

Forked by Jacopo Ferro (@Ciacco99) to add simple syntax from the [tailwind-gradients](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-gradients) plugin. Combined with Hypercolor's features, this makes it easier to use the gradients in your projects without bloating your CSS and basically using the same syntax as native TailwindCSS.
